"""Runtime verification that image URLs resolve to a real asset.

Closes the gap left by ``ValidationUtils.is_absolute_url()`` (which only
checks the URL scheme). A well-formed but non-existent Cloudinary URL like
``https://res.cloudinary.com/.../hc_properties/.../master_bedroom.webp``
passes the scheme check yet returns HTTP 404; this module rejects such URLs
by issuing a minimal ranged GET and inspecting the status.

Design notes
------------
* Uses the shared ``get_general_client()`` httpx pool per AGENTS.md; never
  creates an ephemeral ``httpx.AsyncClient``.
* Sends ``Range: bytes=0-0`` to download at most one byte. Cloudinary and
  most CDNs honour this; servers that ignore ``Range`` still return a 2xx
  status code we accept on.
* 2xx and 3xx responses are treated as OK; 4xx/5xx and network errors are
  treated as failures. The function never raises.
* Cloudinary hostnames are treated as first-party and hard-block on failure.
  Third-party hosts (legacy ``nobroker.in`` etc.) are soft: a verification
  failure logs a warning but still returns True, so transient third-party
  outages do not break property creation.
