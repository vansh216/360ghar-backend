"""Shared httpx.AsyncClient singletons for connection reuse.

Creating a new ``httpx.AsyncClient`` per request allocates a fresh SSL
context, DNS resolver, and connection pool — then tears it all down after
one call.  Using shared clients avoids that overhead and enables TCP
connection keep-alive across requests.

Three domain-specific clients are provided:

| Client    | Default timeout | Max connections | Keepalive | Used by                      |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| scraper   | 30 s            | 10              | 3         | data-hub scrapers, jamabandi |
| blog      | 120 s           | 5               | 2         | Perplexity, SerpAPI          |
| general   | 30 s            | 5               | 2         | misc HTTP, image downloads   |

Per-request ``timeout=`` overrides are supported — httpx applies the
per-request value over the client default.

Lifecycle:
    - Clients are lazily created on first access.
    - ``close_all_clients()`` is called during app shutdown from lifespan.
